- 👋 Hi, I’m Soroar-Mia
- 👀 I’m interested in regularly keeping myself updated about the new skills. This means I always ensure my skills are kept up to date within this rapidly          changing industry.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning JavaScript since it's a powerful language. What I understand is you can use it for the backend and frontend. I've learning  C++ 
      for a long time.
- 💞️ I am looking forward to collaborating with you.
